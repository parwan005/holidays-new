There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

From the moment of arrival the service is exemplary but not at all overbearing. We booked a middle range Lagoon Terrace room but we're incredibly pleased by the views, orientation and impeccable cleanliness. Lagoon views with leafy shaded walkways and ponds gave perfect respite from baking April temperatures.\n\nWe did not need to the leave the resort, pool, beach (immaculate and populated sparsely by only hotel guests, lifeguards abound) spa and restaurants are all fabulous, with lots of complimentary daily activities for kids and adults to boot and gym and tennis courts also. Extensive menus to suit all tastes and excellent breakfast buffet. Would truly recommend the fresh fish at Susegado watching the sun go down. \n\nWish we could have stayed longer and wouldn't hesitate to return over any of the other 5 star resorts in Goa.",

Anyway\nIt was so good, despite being same prices as UK ,I decided to treat myself to one the following day, despite being the end of the season they were fully booked :(\nLuckily I managed another before we had to go home\nThis time I went for 90 minutes\nAlthough the photo shows the price of a Swedish massage what I actually had was a holistic massage \nJust bliss thank you Zoe \n\nEvery night we have had cocktails in the lobby (11 of us ) bar they are absolutely Fantastic \nWe got there at happy hour prices very good bearing in mind the passion that Nityanand puts into making them\nHe is so attentive as are his team , and he was so happy when we praised his skill,\nEvery night we had a lovely welcome from him and a sincere thanks after\nTrouble is after 3 of them it was hard to walk to the fishermans wharf restaurant over the road !\n\nProsecco isn't great in Goa , so we kept to cocktails and beer\n\n",

Travelling with kids we chose the room with the space taken in ... its just less stressful not to keep things from flying into the lagoon .... the rooms are clean, spacious and comfortable. \n\nThe resort is extremely children friendly with a great kids activity area. \nThe pool is a relaxing space to spend time with a book or with your kids.\nThe beach is lovely, clean and without local hawkers invading your space. \nThe food at the restaurant is delicious (we came back a few kilos heavier) , the staff warm and cordial and not minding the nuisances of the kids there.\n\nThe one drawback that I would like the management to consider, and change, is to come up with a formula for all meals included customers to enjoy the other specialty restaurants rather than having to pay the full price. \n\nWE had a lovely 4 days at the Leela and look forward to coming back again very soon.\nI would also like to mention Manager Indira and Chef Aniket B. who went the extra mile in making sure that we were comfortable.",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

Lot of variety on the breakfast menu. The pool was big and clean. The beach was just a short walk away ..the bar and restaurant by the beach were good enough in the absence of shacks .

The beach is amazing,very clean and quiet. The service is excellent.The hotel caters for weddings frequently but this does not detract from the overall experience. The food is OK,not the hotels best feature.\nTwo tips,the restaurant just outside is well priced and tasty,the shop next door is a rip off,exploiting 5 star guests.",

                  "travellerComment": "Hi,\nMyself and my new husband stayed for 10 nights at the zuri white sands and was amazed at how beautiful the hotel is.\nHowever there were some negatives as well as positives.\nOn arrival after a 9 hour flight and a 45 taxi journey to the hotel no refreshments were offered to neither of us, and it was witnessed by ourselves and other people that other people on arrival were offered refreshments.\nOur first night we settled in bed around 3.30am after arriving at 2am at goa airport and was awoken a couple of hours by loud banging noises and sawing. We had not been informed by the hotel staff that construction work was being done above us! \nWe had no time to adjust to the time difference.\nWhen trying to socialise at the pool was hard to hear other people as the noise was so loud and this noise continued right throughout the day.\nAfter the first day myself and my new husband decided to sit out on the balcony and relax which did not happen as my husbands chair collapsed under him which resulted in my husband falling to the side and banging his head on the floor and sustaining open wounds to his ankles and foot! \nWhen asked staff for an incident for m was told that it was not necessary for one to be completed. Staff members came to the room to remove the chair and informed ourselves that the leg of the chair was extremely rusty and caused this. Rust and debris was all over the floor on the balcony.\nFor 3 days we were awoken to the sounds of construction sounds until my husband complained that we were severely exhausted with it despite going to bed early on our honeymoon and he asked for a room change which we got.\nSome of the staff members were extremely rude but a duty manager Elaine was extremely helpful and understanding with us both.\nMy husband and I were offered a free nights dinner in the Buffett bar due to the injuries sustained. Food rating in our eyes were poor and would advise people to eat outside of the hotel. On the beach there is a shack which is not owned by the hotel and the food there is excellent.\nOn changing rooms my husband was assured that everything was safety checked.\nI am sure this was not completely true and my husband could have suffered an electric shock as when he went to plug a charger in plug socket exposed live wires.\nAgain maintenance came to the room and had to completely change the whole socket.\nThe hotel offered us 30% of the bar bill which we feel was an insult to us both through to the stress and worrying endured by us both.\nThe hotel itself is lovely and well kept and the staff are lovely caring people apart from select few duty managers.\nThere is a Chinese restaurant and food is fantastic.\nThe views are beautiful is you are offered a room with a view!\nI would advise not to eat at the BBQ, after eating at the BBQ I became sick with diarrhoea and vomiting for 10 days thankfully this was at the end of my stay.\nThe hotel does not inform you of the tax they charge on both alcohol and soft drinks and this also increases a persons bill.\nThe pool is beautiful and I believe that if these things had not happened or we did not have to listen to the construction work then our stay would have been wonderful.\nI would recommend this holiday to anyone.\n",

Great pool and fabulous beach only a few minutes walk away.  Rooms comfortable with a large walk in shower in the bathroom however if could have been a bit cleaner especially the tiles in the bathroom.  Main restaurant quite good although the breakfast selection of cereals was poor.  Only 3 to choose from and no dried fruits, nuts or seeds.  This is possibly because the guests are mainly Indian.  However the quality of the food was very good.  In the evening we availed of the A la Carte on 2 nights, much better valuer than the 1300 Rupee buffet, and Fins fish restaurant on one night, expensive but the fresh fish was excellent and worth the price.  We ate outside the hotel on the other night which was very cheap.  During the day we ate in the shack restaurant on the beach, Alysha,  excellent cold beers and tandoori chicken, great value and recommended.  I believe if you stay 5 nights or more the hotel offer discounted buffet tickets, 900 instead of 1300 which would be good value.  This hotel would be much better if there was an \"All Inclusive\" option available.",

History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

But writing review first time, the property, staff, wellness, architecture, food, pool, bar, everything is very nice. I have been in weddings as well there, and the team supports a lot.\nBeach view is very nice, being a private beach gives more rest and hassle free stay.",

It is a beautiful property , clean spacious rooms opening to pool and gardens..well maintained lawns. The service of the staff was good and the food served was really good. Lot of variety on the breakfast menu. The pool was big and clean. The beach was just a short walk away ..the bar and restaurant by the beach were good enough in the absence of shacks . Overall it was a memorable experience..",

The beach is amazing,very clean and quiet. The service is excellent.The hotel caters for weddings frequently but this does not detract from the overall experience. The food is OK,not the hotels best feature.\nTwo tips,the restaurant just outside is well priced and tasty,the shop next door is a rip off,exploiting 5 star guests.",

                  "travellerComment": "Hi,\nMyself and my new husband stayed for 10 nights at the zuri white sands and was amazed at how beautiful the hotel is.\nHowever there were some negatives as well as positives.\nOn arrival after a 9 hour flight and a 45 taxi journey to the hotel no refreshments were offered to neither of us, and it was witnessed by ourselves and other people that other people on arrival were offered refreshments.\nOur first night we settled in bed around 3.30am after arriving at 2am at goa airport and was awoken a couple of hours by loud banging noises and sawing. We had not been informed by the hotel staff that construction work was being done above us! \nWe had no time to adjust to the time difference.\nWhen trying to socialise at the pool was hard to hear other people as the noise was so loud and this noise continued right throughout the day.\nAfter the first day myself and my new husband decided to sit out on the balcony and relax which did not happen as my husbands chair collapsed under him which resulted in my husband falling to the side and banging his head on the floor and sustaining open wounds to his ankles and foot! \nWhen asked staff for an incident for m was told that it was not necessary for one to be completed. Staff members came to the room to remove the chair and informed ourselves that the leg of the chair was extremely rusty and caused this. Rust and debris was all over the floor on the balcony.\nFor 3 days we were awoken to the sounds of construction sounds until my husband complained that we were severely exhausted with it despite going to bed early on our honeymoon and he asked for a room change which we got.\nSome of the staff members were extremely rude but a duty manager Elaine was extremely helpful and understanding with us both.\nMy husband and I were offered a free nights dinner in the Buffett bar due to the injuries sustained. Food rating in our eyes were poor and would advise people to eat outside of the hotel. On the beach there is a shack which is not owned by the hotel and the food there is excellent.\nOn changing rooms my husband was assured that everything was safety checked.\nI am sure this was not completely true and my husband could have suffered an electric shock as when he went to plug a charger in plug socket exposed live wires.\nAgain maintenance came to the room and had to completely change the whole socket.\nThe hotel offered us 30% of the bar bill which we feel was an insult to us both through to the stress and worrying endured by us both.\nThe hotel itself is lovely and well kept and the staff are lovely caring people apart from select few duty managers.\nThere is a Chinese restaurant and food is fantastic.\nThe views are beautiful is you are offered a room with a view!\nI would advise not to eat at the BBQ, after eating at the BBQ I became sick with diarrhoea and vomiting for 10 days thankfully this was at the end of my stay.\nThe hotel does not inform you of the tax they charge on both alcohol and soft drinks and this also increases a persons bill.\nThe pool is beautiful and I believe that if these things had not happened or we did not have to listen to the construction work then our stay would have been wonderful.\nI would recommend this holiday to anyone.\n",

                  "travellerComment": "We stayed 4 nights here following an exhausting 10 day tour of the \"Golden Triangle\".  This hotel was just what the doctor ordered.  Great pool and fabulous beach only a few minutes walk away.  Rooms comfortable with a large walk in shower in the bathroom however if could have been a bit cleaner especially the tiles in the bathroom.  Main restaurant quite good although the breakfast selection of cereals was poor.  Only 3 to choose from and no dried fruits, nuts or seeds.  This is possibly because the guests are mainly Indian.  However the quality of the food was very good.  In the evening we availed of the A la Carte on 2 nights, much better valuer than the 1300 Rupee buffet, and Fins fish restaurant on one night, expensive but the fresh fish was excellent and worth the price.  We ate outside the hotel on the other night which was very cheap.  During the day we ate in the shack restaurant on the beach, Alysha,  excellent cold beers and tandoori chicken, great value and recommended.  I believe if you stay 5 nights or more the hotel offer discounted buffet tickets, 900 instead of 1300 which would be good value.  This hotel would be much better if there was an \"All Inclusive\" option available.",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

                  "travellerComment": "This is the second year we are staying at this hotel. When we visit goa we stay almost 9-10 days. As the name suggest it is more of a guest house then a hotel. Don't expect for food or drinks as they don't serve, however u can order from close by restaurants. Breakfast is available, but only egg items and bread with tea or coffee. Rooms are not spacious but comfortable. Bathroom is clean with 24/7 hot water. There are 2 boys in the name of staff. However, they are helpful, goodmannerd and softspoken. Room has LCD TV and split ac. Not all channels are available especially sports. But who watches TV when u r on vacation. WiFi is available and speed is fine. You need to be in the courtyard to access WiFi as the WiFi network goes off when u r in the room. The Courtyard is clean and has two tables with 3 chairs to spend ur time. There is a small recreation area at the back with 2 bean bags. U also can wash ur clothes and hangers are provided in the recreation area to dry clothes. They don't accept credit cards though so be prepared to pay in cash or EFT. The best thing is that the owner \"Mogambo\" also deals in car and bike rentals. U can hire a cab though him for pickup and drop from airport or railway station. Also, u can take bike, Scooter or car on rent. The rate varies depending upon the model and number of days. U have choice of activa, dio, avenger, fz, royal Enfield, navi..etc and cars like i10 or Chevy spark. Petrol is cheaper compared to other states and also available in every nook and corner in 1 ltr bisleri bottle. This hotel is nearby to some famous places like mango tree, thalassa, bean me up, chaporo fort, anjuna beach and small vagator beach. Anjuna petrol pump is close by. Also, next to petrol pump is Sita udupi hotel where u can have breakfast at reasonable rates. Having stayed here twice I like the place and have no complaints except for one that they don't accept credit cards. Hope they do that in future.",

The service provided by the staff is excellent.Tea/coffee is available.  I would recommend not to opt for a breakfast included package - there is no variety available , rather you order from the nearby restaurant or go out to eat. If you get a deal withing 900-1200/- INR per night its a good deal.Beds are comfy and service is prompt , since our AC wasnt cooling they got the repair guy to visit and fix it.  Wifi doesnt reach all the rooms.",

The room allotted to us was big, airy with a nice balcony. There were lot of  soothing greenery  all around for the sore eyes . The pool was nice and inviting and the well stocked bar right at the edge of the pool was a novelty. There was even a mini golf course for the die hard golfer. The beach beyond the golf course was however was a damper. Food was excellent and service satisfactory. Overall good value for money.",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

We had booked Aryans for a 5K per room per night & looking at the pictures we were doubtful if the place would turn out to be exactly the way it was shown in the pictures. But when we checked in we were just taken aback by the view - the rooms are sea facing and then in the middle of the view lies the pool. Woahhhh!!\n\nThe rooms, the washrooms & the facilities were pretty much on the point. The beach is very accessible & so is Thalassa. Thalassa & Aryans are literally neighbors which saved us a lot of time & money you can say. We partied at Thalassa in the evening, ate & came back & then jammed by the pool side dancing to the tune of the music being played at Thalassa.",

It is next to thallasa (famoue greek restaurant) and ozran heights resort on the other. \n\nWe had booked deluxe cottage. the rooms were neat and clean. Very close to the beach. Breakfast was complimentary and food was so relishing. \n\nYup...The butter garlic prawns were just awesome. Nice sitout..with a beautiful beach view and good music from thallassa. \n\nThere's nothing much we could ask for. This place is perfect for family with kids. \nPeople at hotel were kind, friendly and made us feel very comfortable.",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

The swimming pool of this hotel very attractively and pool water very clean. We were very enjoy there. Food of this hotel just \"lajawab\". Its Indian & European mixture. But very expensive.

                  "travellerComment": "Visited the Seashell Beach Suites for 9 days with my husband and 4 year old son. Excellent communication with Mario throughout including a potential change of dates which fortunately was avoided. First time long haul with our son and arrived after a few days in Kochi, had enforced change of flight with Indigo so arrived about 11pm instead of 3pm not ideal. However met by the hotel's charming driver Rohan in his brand new air con car and was at hotel within 45 minutes.Later used Rohan for a trip out to see elephants and Old Goa - excellent and extremely eloquent driver. \nWe were in 2 bedroomed apartment, check in a breeze and apartment fantastic - spacious, clean,air con throughout, better cable (football, 6 nations, movies, kids stuff) than most apartments we have stayed in Europe, really REALLY comfortable beds and great showers. Very peaceful at night as just away from busy main road. Delighted to have a free breakfast included ( a surprise) which we utilised most days - good choice of Indian dishes dosas, and usual eggs, sausages fruit etc and lovely juices. Pool area lovely with plenty of beds, used pool and room service couple of times both excellent. As stated in previous reviews a kids pool would be really welcome and there is room for it...\n5-10 mins walk to beach shacks and dozens of restaurants and  2 supermarkets very close.  Security guys at hotel ever present which was great when travelling with family. Potential negatives - yes this hotel is relatively expensive- for India- and you still get power cuts, stray dogs outside etc this is India (!) so don't expect otherwise - but overall a truly amazing place to stay, fantastic staff, beautiful gardens, perfect location, and real comfort if an aparthotel style complex is what you are looking for. NB Candolim is really touristy in season so if you are visiting be prepared - can feel like the Canaries at times with hordes of Brits and Russians - this is not the road less travelled but great for a family trip and the local people are incredibly hospitable.\nWe would not hesitate to visit this hotel again if in Candolim.",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

Probably amongst the best in goa (excluding Leela) but apart from a comfortable bed and clean tidy room and sunset view i would not really rate it much as a 4 star. The food was ok, certainly not close to some of the beech shacks, one called Fishermans hut in particular. The staff were also helpfull and peasant. Goa has a charm like knowere ive been and this was the first time we traded up in hotel star's, did i enjoy it more ? No!\n",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

Probably amongst the best in goa (excluding Leela) but apart from a comfortable bed and clean tidy room and sunset view i would not really rate it much as a 4 star. The food was ok, certainly not close to some of the beech shacks, one called Fishermans hut in particular. The staff were also helpfull and peasant. Goa has a charm like knowere ive been and this was the first time we traded up in hotel star's, did i enjoy it more ? No!\n",

We had booked Aryans for a 5K per room per night & looking at the pictures we were doubtful if the place would turn out to be exactly the way it was shown in the pictures. But when we checked in we were just taken aback by the view - the rooms are sea facing and then in the middle of the view lies the pool. Woahhhh!!\n\nThe rooms, the washrooms & the facilities were pretty much on the point. The beach is very accessible & so is Thalassa. Thalassa & Aryans are literally neighbors which saved us a lot of time & money you can say. We partied at Thalassa in the evening, ate & came back & then jammed by the pool side dancing to the tune of the music being played at Thalassa.",

Nice sitout..with a beautiful beach view and good music from thallassa. \n\nThere's nothing much we could ask for.

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

                  "travellerComment": "Visited the Seashell Beach Suites for 9 days with my husband and 4 year old son. Excellent communication with Mario throughout including a potential change of dates which fortunately was avoided. First time long haul with our son and arrived after a few days in Kochi, had enforced change of flight with Indigo so arrived about 11pm instead of 3pm not ideal. However met by the hotel's charming driver Rohan in his brand new air con car and was at hotel within 45 minutes.Later used Rohan for a trip out to see elephants and Old Goa - excellent and extremely eloquent driver. \nWe were in 2 bedroomed apartment, check in a breeze and apartment fantastic - spacious, clean,air con throughout, better cable (football, 6 nations, movies, kids stuff) than most apartments we have stayed in Europe, really REALLY comfortable beds and great showers. Very peaceful at night as just away from busy main road. Delighted to have a free breakfast included ( a surprise) which we utilised most days - good choice of Indian dishes dosas, and usual eggs, sausages fruit etc and lovely juices. Pool area lovely with plenty of beds, used pool and room service couple of times both excellent. As stated in previous reviews a kids pool would be really welcome and there is room for it...\n5-10 mins walk to beach shacks and dozens of restaurants and  2 supermarkets very close.  Security guys at hotel ever present which was great when travelling with family. Potential negatives - yes this hotel is relatively expensive- for India- and you still get power cuts, stray dogs outside etc this is India (!) so don't expect otherwise - but overall a truly amazing place to stay, fantastic staff, beautiful gardens, perfect location, and real comfort if an aparthotel style complex is what you are looking for. NB Candolim is really touristy in season so if you are visiting be prepared - can feel like the Canaries at times with hordes of Brits and Russians - this is not the road less travelled but great for a family trip and the local people are incredibly hospitable.\nWe would not hesitate to visit this hotel again if in Candolim.",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

Special shout out to mr Rupesh the exec. Sous chef at the grand Hyatt Goa.\nThe grand club staff were great and made us feel at home. The only issue was that the check in was slow because we used the reception to check in. But we checked out at the grand club lounge and it was amazing and fast and we were offered drinks. We had complementary breakfast at the dining room. But the standout were the staff. The chefs had great knowledge about the food they were serving. A shout-out to the serving staff at the chulha restaurant. The resort centre staff lady helped us plan our day and she made our last day fun and productive. I also loved the outdoor seating area although the beach was a let down. Thank you grand Hyatt for making my stay memorable and a fun-filled one.I also want to thank the lady who served us at the grand club although I forgot her name.",

Meandering pathways & nice open air eating spots around the spacious pool incl separate, but connected, ppl for kids.\n\nGround + 2 ensures great privacy and the beauty of a mansion effect rather than of a matchbox hotel.\n\nThe Bay view room was lovely with a big verandah to sit & watch the sunset. \nGreat breakfast !\n\nVery polite staff.

The ham and cheese being excellent. Desserts were all spectacular. The staff are really some of the most professional, knowledgeable and helpful I have encountered right from the outlet Manager Allen to some of the others including Sibashish, Ajen, Sachin and Saurabh.

Made use of the spa on multiple occasions and highly recommend the abhayanga massage. The lap pool was perfect for a regular swimmers. The rooms were good sized and well attended. The sea facing rooms in the block F were very good. The brunch at the main dining hall gets really crazy with too many guests crammed into the hall but the food selection is exemplary and the service at the table is commendable. I highly recommend taking the brunch package with the Hyatt club option. They serve drinks and canapes all through the day and is very filling if you have a sumptuous brunch.",

They really couldn't do enough and everyone was so friendly - from house keeping to the chefs to the waiting staff. Aesthetically, the hotel is beautiful - grand but modern at the same time and the grounds are huge and beautifully kept. The facilities are excellent, especially the on site Indian restaurant Chulha: the best Indian food I have eaten from a number of different regions of the country. Fresh and delicious (try the Sev puri!). The pools are large and relaxing and there were always enough pool chairs and umbrellas. The kids pool were perfect for our 6 and 3 year olds who could splash around for hours safely as there were plenty of shady areas at various times of day. Breakfast was really excellent (loved the mysore masala dosas) with a huge choice of dishes freshly cooked to order. The room itself was very nice - large, clean and well appointed. The balcony was large and the fan was a godsend! The balcony would benefit from a spruce up as the railings were a bit rusty, but I believe they were carrying this out during our stay on a number of the guest houses. One last thing: the Wicked Liquid Sunday Brunch is incredible - free pour champagne and amazing food. Best value thing we did at the hotel.\n\nNegative It seems like a pointless comment given that it's a 5 star grand hyatt but the prices for drinks, taxis etc are almost prohibitively high when you add in taxes and service etc. The bill after a week's stay was eye watering but that's our fault for being gluttons! Otherwise, the beach itself is pretty uninspiring but the pools are so nice that it's really not an issue.",

                  "travellerComment": "My partner and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt for 4 days In April and loved every minute.\n\nHotel is stunning - Pool is great, the best we have been to and very large. Cuould have had a little bit more attention to detail regarding rubbish under sun beds e.g empty water bottles. Very clean grounds otherwise and very well kept.\n\nChoice of dining/bars also good.\n\nCheck in was smooth and really pleasant.\nService around the hotel is impeccable and we loved the fact that the staff remembered us every day and out room number so we didn't have to keep telling them.\nStaff around the pool were great, two in particular (we did not catch the names of but 1 always wears a straw hat and works at the pool bar, the other wears green glasses and was around the pool) kept us topped up on drinks, remembering what we ordered each time and laying out towels for us when he saw us coming - thanks for making it such a memorable experience!\n\nFood at the pool bar was delicious! We had lunch there every day, and the evening when it changed to a chinese/asian diner.\n\nCocktails were also very nice! We tended to stick to buckets of 5 Kingfishers (999 rupees) working out  a bit cheaper than 275 rupees each - almost 2 free!\n\nWe paid the £25 a day for use of the Grand club room and would DEFINITELY recommend it if you can. Very civilised and quiet, again impeccable service and a lovely quiet area of the hotel away from the hustle and bustle - complimentary canapes and alcoholic drinks between 6-8pm, complimentary soft drinks and coffea/tea all day, complimentary high tea at lunchtime and complimentary airport transfers. Also complimentary continental breakfast which was MUCH less crowded and civilised than the main dining room.\nBreakfast in the dining room was fine - great choice of food but very very crowded and pushed around.\nAll in all worth every penny! Especially if you have a few drinks and canapes before dinner each night, and for the complimentary airport transfer - otherwise £25 too.\n\nOur room was sea facing as we have no complaints at all - it was lovely! Made up every day and plenty of towels/robes/toiletries.\n\nGrounds around hotel are lovely too, plenty to walk around and plenty of activities. Sea is murky and bay is pebbly/shells but still nice to walk along and sit on it you want - there are sunbeds down there.\n\nLoved the hammocks dotted around! spent many an evening chilling in them.\n\nThanks VERY VERY much to a member of staff at the Capiz bar who handed in my watch which i left on the table one evening! If i hadn't have found that, then that would have ruined my holiday - very honest staff!!\n\nA few points that could have been improved on - \n\n- Sunday brunch open to members of the public - this makes the hotel and pool VERY crowded! We couldn't find a decent sun bed and couldn't really swim in the pool. This day breakfast was horrible and crowded. Not really fair been as we are paying for the hotel and our holiday but was only crowded until lunch time.\n\n- On last night there was some kind of concert in the ground, right outside our room!? Very very loud and lots of people. Luckily we had had a big win in the casino that night so had had quite a few drinks and managed to sleep through, but i imagine some people would not have been so lucky.\nFor these points we would have complained had everything else about the stay not been pretty good so we didn't feel the need.\n\n- Security guards make you feel secure but are a little intimidating, especially when you're having a stroll at night.\n\nHotel has nothing around it but you don't really need to leave for anything. we took a taxi into Panjim and he would wait every time we got out to look around shops which made us feel very at ease, Only trouble was, the hotel did not tell us that the shops were all closed as it was Sunday! lol, oh well.\n\nOverall a fab stay - we will be returning in the future!\n\nps. cats around the grounds are very friendly and sweet",

The hotel is enormous with very impressive grounds and everything you could wish for to have a relaxing holiday.\nWe were a family of 2 adults and 4 children including a 4 month baby! The rooms are all set within guest houses in a Portuguese style. We had two interconnecting rooms which initially were tired but after a chat we were moved to what can only be described as rooms that were incredible! The suite contained a bedroom and a massive sitting room and for that added special touch a jacuzzi on the balcony! The rooms are very well appointed with all mod cons including international plug points.\nFor food, you are spoilt with choice from the dining room which serves breakfast, and buffet style lunches and dinners as well as ala carte offerings, Chula for the all important Indian experience, Veranda for steaks and fusion cuisine as well as poolside bars and cafes this hotel has it all! \nWhat sets this hotel apart is the staff. From start to finish, the team could not do enough! From cutting up mangos that were picked off the trees to finding emergency infant milk, nothing was a problem. We came as guests and left as friends. \nWe would like thank each and everyone of the team with special mentions for Akash and Maria from guest relations, Lynne from rooms, exec chef Rupesh and Chefs Vicky and Shibendu, who made sure my every culinary wish was fulfilled. The amazing team Kushal, Sachin, Vishal, Allen, Tushar, Aaron, Kartik and by the poolside - Gaurang with the fab lifeguards. \nCan't wait to come back. If you haven't been, do it now.

The resort is spread out over very large lush well-maitained grounds and beach front.  If you want lots of action and beach bars you'll find that in the northern beaches.  Here, its quiet and laid back.  We almost had the huge beach to ourselves, and that was perfect for us.  We did visit the northern beaches, which was fun, but wouldn't want to be staying there.  The Hyatt had multiple restaurants with a variety of cuisines to choose from -- service and food were fine.  Be sure to have one dinner at the restaurant on the beach where you can pick from the daily catch.  We found all of the staff members to be friendly and helpful.  Be aware that there's really no places to walk to from the hotel, although everything you need is at the resort.  We found the location just fine for all our tours of Goa and the surrounding areas.",

At first look, everything seemed amazing. The welcome was good, though a bit long specially with the heat and two infants in tow. Eventually got 2 rooms out of 5. Not that we were too early to check in.\nOnce settled in the rooms, began exploring the property. Great activities for kids, paid and unpaid. Wonderful pool, with different levels. Though a bit awkward to get from one level to other. \nWorth a mention is the poor cleanliness and maintenance of the rooms, bathrooms and passages. From what I could see, it's due to too many corporate events happening. The property has lost its grandness and exclusivity. \nAlso I could not relate to the interiors of the rooms. The TV is on the side of the bed. Really! There were in all 6 big and small tables in the room. One big white round table without any purpose on the side of the bed. Useless. One small coffe table, 2 study tables adjoining the wall, 2 tables in the balcony! If you are with a toddler, that leaves no space to leave them on their own in the room. A accident is sure to happen.\nPoor lighting in the bathroom, specially the shower area, which also comes with a long list of how to operate the shower! \nWorth mentioning and the only thing upto the mark is their restaurant CHULHA, which serves superb Indian cuisine. In fact one of the finest. \nEven their Oriental and Sheesha Bar were excellent. The room service is another story altogether. Poor service, not much choice of food and stubborn to alter any preparations or procure it from any of their restaurants.\nThese issues if looked into can be resolved for sure in a short time. The management just needs to get on track.\n",

We had issue with the pool and food not as per standard .pool not cleaned especially kids pool . How can u have children have food items to eat in the pool and why are people walking around the pool and then dipping their dirty legs in the pool . There should be staff keeping a check on proper swim wear n no food allowed in the pool . \nNext issue was the food , as there was a wedding to much crowd that could me a\nReason food not as per the standard it should be . To much repetitions and re use of items in the buffet . The service at the dinning room was good though no complains on the service . \nThe gym and in door pool was good . If u are a gym freak u would love the gym as they have good equipment for each part of the body . \nThe resort common area  is clean and well kept . \nThe play area for the kids is just to good if your kids enough to be left at there kids camp that starts from 10am to 9pm . Staff at the kids camp  are kids friendly and take good care of the kids and will call u if required . \nOverall an ok experience. May try and other resort if visit goa again . ",

After complaint we got to see all rooms available and choose the one we booked. The entrance is not at all comfortable and staff is hard to understand do to noise. This is not at all a 5 star hotel. Some positives: Christopher of the restaurant is a nice guy, perhaps the only one. Also the food is quite okay.",

The way its made with its small front, its easy to miss it if you aren't using maps. The proch n parking area is really small for the Deltin brand name though the property opens up inside. Cute little pool welcomes you as u walk in. \nRoom size is decent with seating for four and a mini dry kitchen. But, problems start from here on..\n1) ac is fitted in sitting area which means your bed area is warmer. And the air con water was leaking down to the sofa. \n2) went down for dinner at 8:20 and inspite of that, buffet wasnt ready. We were asked to wait!!\n3) called house keeping to ask for extra drinking water and they said its chargeable. So i requested for normal filter water to which they refused. Big shock. How can u refuse filtered water and instead try to make some bucks selling bottles??\n4) Life is really small by this hotels standards.\n5) Only 1 charging point next to beds. Unacceptable in this age of gizmos.\n\nWas really looking forward to Deltin hospitality. Bad experience. ",

The hotel was a 20 minute drive from Panjim and the casinos and we were offered a curtesy vehicle of going to the casino. The hotel was clean and well designed but most of the guests were loud and rude and breakfast was a total riot! \nThe house keeping staff were wonderful and couldn't be more helpful but I'm not sure that I would ever stay again as there are much better options in Panjim.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

The pool is free-style and very attractive, especially when lit up at night and the grounds too are beautiful. The rooms are in individual chalet style buildings with one room on the ground floor and one on the upstairs level and are beautifully appointed. The bed was very comfortable and the wet room nicely laid out with a shower which provided plenty of water and was easily controlled temperature wise with no fluctuations either in volume or temperature.\nThe admin block is well set up with reception, bar and restaurant all of which are tastefully decorated. There is also a games area, in a separate block, which has a library of second hand books as well as table-tennis. We did not, however avail ourselves of this so I am a little hazy about the details. Downstairs in this block there are also toilets and showers which are handy when using the swimming pool.\nOn check-in we were greeted with a welcome drink of coconut juice in a coconut and we were allowed to eat the flesh afterwards.\nAll the staff we came into contact with were helpful and friendly without being over familiar and always seemed to be on hand when needed but without giving the impression of hovering.\nThe one problem, however, was the food. Given the quality of the hotel, we were expecting something special but were bitterly disappointed. Our first meal was a snack lunch taken beside the swimming pool. My wife had chicken satay which was acceptable and I had nachos which were not very good. For dinner, the first night, my wife had prawn cocktail followed by chicken in tarragon sauce and I had crab-cakes followed by surf and turf. My wife's starter was over-spiced and there was a distinct shortage of prawns whereas my crab cakes were ok but the accompanying dip had to be used very sparingly or the chilly flavour would totally overpower the crab. Our main courses both contained meat which was so tough as to be virtually inedible and my steak was overcooked. When we complained the chef came out and admitted that he thought the chicken had looked dry and tough when he took it from the oven. We didn't dare have a dessert and as far as possible ate elsewhere.\nThe breakfasts were ok but the bacon was tough and chewy.\nOn our last evening we again ate at the hotel. Our starters were ok and so was my wife's main course of linguini. I tried the pork chops which, again, were so tough as to be indigestible.\nIt would appear that the proprietor needs to change both his chef and his butcher urgently!\nThe final criticism is the price. At the equivalent of £120 per night this hotel is charging at the level of good quality hotels in London (we only paid £100 per night at the Hilton near Heathrow) but without the associated costs in terms of staff, power or taxes.",

Pool was great and very safe for our toddler. He enjoyed the pool toys. The beach is very close and clean by Indian standards. Quiet and largely used by locals. We loved it! Patrolled by lifeguards ensured safety. Security guards also on hand. Breakfast was good. Food at restaurant fair otherwise ok...we enjoyed the mocktails by the poolside! Only downside was the driver provided by the hotel the night we ventured to the Saturday night markets. He was reckless and ended up leaving us stranded for a long period. Upon his return he argued with us which was unacceptable. This was a disappointing blemish on an otherwise wonderful holiday. Would recommend to family's :)",

We stayed here whilst attending a wedding and the staff were very helpful. The breakfast was average. Rooms were clean. It is a bit out of the way, so if travelling to visit other places from here bear in mind that taxis will be a little more expensive. Overall a great couple of nights stay.",

                  "travellerComment": "We visited Coconut creek in February and stayed there for 2N/3D. We were a big bunch comprising  of adults and kids and were a noisy lot! One of the biggest pros is its proximity to the Dabolim airport (not more than a 10-min drive) and added bonus is complimentary transfers to the airport which made things very comfortable and the overall experience hassle free (considering that we had kids). Hospitality offered is absolutely commendable! Rooms are not many in number and that makes it a cozy little place, a 5-min walk from the Bogmalo Beach. It is a quiet beach with pristine sands, a visual treat during sunset and sunrise. Food in the resort is above average but the nearest joint - Joet's, which is located on the beach, is more popular as it has better food and ambiance (of course as it's ocean front!). Last but not the least, one should not miss visiting Claudie's (located a few km away from the resort). This place has amazing food and beverages with a vibrant ambiance. We could sit here like all day and still not get bored! Must visit for the resort guests.\nIt was a very pleasant experience at Coconut Creek and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",

Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash. We have not forgotten them and I am sure we will come back again to beautiful resort rio hotel.",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

The pool was nice and inviting and the well stocked bar right at the edge of the pool was a novelty. There was even a mini golf course for the die hard golfer. The beach beyond the golf course was however was a damper. Food was excellent and service satisfactory. Overall good value for money.",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

We choose Morjim beach area (it's close Ashwem, Mandrem, etc.) because we have never been to far north before and we have had read that it's very nice place....very serene. After going through reviews and talking to Mr.Lamba (Owner of Baywalk Villa) and Ms.Swati (Manager - Supervisor) I decided to go for Baywalk. From the time we reached Goa, Swati has been always been very helpful, she was always very nice. She suggested us to visit Saturday night market in Goa and we went there....it was a great experience!! \nWhen checked-in to Baywalk it gave us very good feel and it's was nice. \nThis villa property is very tastefully decorated, nicely lighted, very clean and well-maintained room and bathroom. All the amenities were working fine and there was no power-cut...so we could use AC whenever needed. Though, nights were pretty cooler, AC wasn't required at all during night. \nFortunately, Mr.Lamba was there when we checked-in...he greeted us and we had a long chat. He is a very nice gentleman. Infact, we had an issue with one of our bag locks. Actually, we forgot the keys and Mr.Lamba helped us in getting that lock open, he took our bag and get it opened...this service was absolutely on humanitarian ground :) It also showed that how much they care for their customers and they will do whatever is needed to make their customers happy, comfortable and feel like home. \nMs.Swati was always available to attend to any queries, she can help in planning your itinerary in Goa, destinations, finding out special parties, offers across Goa's best places, retsaurants, pubs, including Casinos :)  She is really good!! \nAnother very nice, modest person we met here is Mr.Ramesh (Caretaker, Cook). He is very dedicated to his work and he will ensure that he shows the room, explain you all the rules, policies, timings, WiFi password :) and will ensure that you get everything that you need at there place; including food, bikes/scooter, water, beddings, etc. \nOverall, it was one of our best experience in Goa till date (this was our 5th visit to Goa).\nI wish Baywalk team, ALL THE BEST!!! I am sure you guys will do very well...\nSpecial thanks to Swati for being there always...you ROCK!!! \nHope to see you again...  :)",

We had booked for 2 nights but with sudden change in plan we called up and have asked for one more day prior to our booking dates. Swati and Rameshji took good care of all our needs. We took all three rooms at the ground floor. It becomes just like our home with open drawing space combining all three rooms. The only thing is they don't serve lunch and dinner and due to its proximity to turtle beach there are no shacks at night. Still they served us maggie and poha at 11 pm. Another day after doing all adventure activities we were tired enough to go for dinner outside and we requested them to allow us cook our own pulao and they agreed. We really appreciate this kind gesture. The property is neat and clean and has all basic amenities. If you are not looking for ultra luxurious space I strongly recommend Bay walk at Morjim. Beach is just 5-7 minutes away.",

We tried to book this property in Feb 2016 but had a not so good experience in inquiry process itself.\n\nHowever, this year 2017 I was again searching for some place near by morjim beach and came across this choice again. \nWith good reviews on tripadvisor and proximity to beach and a good deal on paytm, I booked.\nFollowing are positive and negatives\n1.We got allotted Narmada and it was a splendid room, I liked the interiors, balcony and overall aesthetics.\n2. Ramesh, the caretaker was very cordial and helped in all our requirements. \n3. 200m from beach, can also take 2 wheeler from this place to beach if one doesn't want to walk.\n4. Indoor games  - foosball, TT .\n5. All promised amenities in working condition. \n\nNegatives\n1. If someone is looking for open spaces and swimming pool like resort, you won't get that here.\n\nOverall a good peaceful stay. Will come back again if we get similar deal in terms of pricing :)",

(also all the hotel have been beautiful wooden decorative).  \nJalsa restaurant was perfect with the best vegetarian food that you have ever seen with kind manager and very delicious food.\nI want to specially thanks from Durgesh, I think he is a supervisor in reception, But he did everything for us, he is a very modest man, he is really great man that he managed a photographer for us that we could take a pictures with our weeding dresses in each parts of hotel that he wanted. Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash.

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

The rooms are very spacious and with fine taste. Do not carry much except your swimming trunk, shorts(without lining otherwise sand will accumulate in between the seam if your are bathing in your shorts) and a few tops. The best part is that the most beautiful and serene  beach CANDOLIM is just a stone throw away where you can go and spend your entire day and even late night at dreamer's shack who will provide you with the best orange juice ever and good music. (You can even purchase your vibrant  beach  cloth from small shops near the candolim beach). If your are interested in site seeing there is a taxi agency from where you can book a taxi.",

My room had a very spacious balcony which never let's you to stop partying. \nThey had already booked us a cab to pick us up from the airport which made a good start for our trip. \nA couple of years ago I had visited goa and stayed in its parent hotel (16 degrees north Baga). Over there I came to know about the owner Mr. Pankaj Kumar, he also has a series of luxury villas. I had the best experience staying in this hotel and had decided whenever I visit goa in the future I'm gonna stay in this chain. \nI would like to give credits to lastminutegoa.in specially Vanessa to help us book our perfect vacation. \n",

We were a group of 14 friends looking for a private and exclusive place entirely to ourselves. This turned out to be perfect!\n\nWhile the walk to the closest beach is about 15 minutes, the size of the rooms for this price is hard to find elsewhere in Goa. The rooms are tastefully furnished with attached balcony and sit out arrangement.  The rooms have a separate living area with a day bed, which can conveniently accommodate an extra person (or 2 kids). Most important, good sized bathrooms ?. Missed the soap dish and towel rings in there, but then we were the first guests, am certain it has been remedied already.\n\nThe reception/ lounge area has a small swimming pool, kitchen and relaxed sitting arrangement. You can hang around here for most part of the day, also have your meals and drinks. Interestingly, the top floor is a penthouse with covered terrace. Which can be enjoyed best in colder months and monsoons.    \n\nFriendly and accommodating staff all day round. Who will gladly run a few errands for you. The kitchen is functional till 10.30-11 pm at night and all meals can be pre ordered. I wished they allowed guests  to access the kitchen!",

The swimming pool of this hotel very attractively and pool water very clean. We were very enjoy there. Food of this hotel just \"lajawab\". Its Indian & European mixture. But very expensive.

                  "travellerComment": "Visited the Seashell Beach Suites for 9 days with my husband and 4 year old son. Excellent communication with Mario throughout including a potential change of dates which fortunately was avoided. First time long haul with our son and arrived after a few days in Kochi, had enforced change of flight with Indigo so arrived about 11pm instead of 3pm not ideal. However met by the hotel's charming driver Rohan in his brand new air con car and was at hotel within 45 minutes.Later used Rohan for a trip out to see elephants and Old Goa - excellent and extremely eloquent driver. \nWe were in 2 bedroomed apartment, check in a breeze and apartment fantastic - spacious, clean,air con throughout, better cable (football, 6 nations, movies, kids stuff) than most apartments we have stayed in Europe, really REALLY comfortable beds and great showers. Very peaceful at night as just away from busy main road. Delighted to have a free breakfast included ( a surprise) which we utilised most days - good choice of Indian dishes dosas, and usual eggs, sausages fruit etc and lovely juices. Pool area lovely with plenty of beds, used pool and room service couple of times both excellent. As stated in previous reviews a kids pool would be really welcome and there is room for it...\n5-10 mins walk to beach shacks and dozens of restaurants and  2 supermarkets very close.  Security guys at hotel ever present which was great when travelling with family. Potential negatives - yes this hotel is relatively expensive- for India- and you still get power cuts, stray dogs outside etc this is India (!) so don't expect otherwise - but overall a truly amazing place to stay, fantastic staff, beautiful gardens, perfect location, and real comfort if an aparthotel style complex is what you are looking for. NB Candolim is really touristy in season so if you are visiting be prepared - can feel like the Canaries at times with hordes of Brits and Russians - this is not the road less travelled but great for a family trip and the local people are incredibly hospitable.\nWe would not hesitate to visit this hotel again if in Candolim.",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

Rooms were simple, clean and pleasant. \n\nLocation, close to the quieter end of the strip which is nice. Short walk to restaurant and bars or if u want to go nearer the busy end of the strip it costs about 300 rupees in a taxi. Also right on the beach, the huts are further spread out down this end and it's much nicer! Sunbeds are held for you by the shack owners who are happy to bring over what ever food and drink you want!\n\nWi-Fi costs around £1.25 a day and works through out the hotel.\n\nAll round nice and relaxing place to stay with little to worry about.",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

But writing review first time, the property, staff, wellness, architecture, food, pool, bar, everything is very nice. I have been in weddings as well there, and the team supports a lot.\nBeach view is very nice, being a private beach gives more rest and hassle free stay.",

It is a beautiful property , clean spacious rooms opening to pool and gardens..well maintained lawns. The service of the staff was good and the food served was really good. Lot of variety on the breakfast menu. The pool was big and clean. The beach was just a short walk away ..the bar and restaurant by the beach were good enough in the absence of shacks . Overall it was a memorable experience..",

The beach is amazing,very clean and quiet. The service is excellent.The hotel caters for weddings frequently but this does not detract from the overall experience. The food is OK,not the hotels best feature.\nTwo tips,the restaurant just outside is well priced and tasty,the shop next door is a rip off,exploiting 5 star guests.",

Great pool and fabulous beach only a few minutes walk away.  Rooms comfortable with a large walk in shower in the bathroom however if could have been a bit cleaner especially the tiles in the bathroom.  Main restaurant quite good although the breakfast selection of cereals was poor.  Only 3 to choose from and no dried fruits, nuts or seeds.  This is possibly because the guests are mainly Indian.  However the quality of the food was very good.  In the evening we availed of the A la Carte on 2 nights, much better valuer than the 1300 Rupee buffet, and Fins fish restaurant on one night, expensive but the fresh fish was excellent and worth the price.  We ate outside the hotel on the other night which was very cheap.  During the day we ate in the shack restaurant on the beach, Alysha,  excellent cold beers and tandoori chicken, great value and recommended.  I believe if you stay 5 nights or more the hotel offer discounted buffet tickets, 900 instead of 1300 which would be good value.  This hotel would be much better if there was an \"All Inclusive\" option available.",

We had not been informed by the hotel staff that construction work was being done above us! \nWe had no time to adjust to the time difference.\nWhen trying to socialise at the pool was hard to hear other people as the noise was so loud and this noise continued right throughout the day.\nAfter the first day myself and my new husband decided to sit out on the balcony and relax which did not happen as my husbands chair collapsed under him which resulted in my husband falling to the side and banging his head on the floor and sustaining open wounds to his ankles and foot! \nWhen asked staff for an incident for m was told that it was not necessary for one to be completed. Staff members came to the room to remove the chair and informed ourselves that the leg of the chair was extremely rusty and caused this. Rust and debris was all over the floor on the balcony.\nFor 3 days we were awoken to the sounds of construction sounds until my husband complained that we were severely exhausted with it despite going to bed early on our honeymoon and he asked for a room change which we got.\nSome of the staff members were extremely rude but a duty manager Elaine was extremely helpful and understanding with us both.\nMy husband and I were offered a free nights dinner in the Buffett bar due to the injuries sustained. Food rating in our eyes were poor and would advise people to eat outside of the hotel. On the beach there is a shack which is not owned by the hotel and the food there is excellent.\nOn changing rooms my husband was assured that everything was safety checked.\nI am sure this was not completely true and my husband could have suffered an electric shock as when he went to plug a charger in plug socket exposed live wires.\nAgain maintenance came to the room and had to completely change the whole socket.\nThe hotel offered us 30% of the bar bill which we feel was an insult to us both through to the stress and worrying endured by us both.\nThe hotel itself is lovely and well kept and the staff are lovely caring people apart from select few duty managers.\nThere is a Chinese restaurant and food is fantastic.\nThe views are beautiful is you are offered a room with a view!\nI would advise not to eat at the BBQ, after eating at the BBQ I became sick with diarrhoea and vomiting for 10 days thankfully this was at the end of my stay.\nThe hotel does not inform you of the tax they charge on both alcohol and soft drinks and this also increases a persons bill.\nThe pool is beautiful and I believe that if these things had not happened or we did not have to listen to the construction work then our stay would have been wonderful.\nI would recommend this holiday to anyone.\n",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

An overall below average overpriced stay at an aging  Taj group property. \n\nThe rooms are really big but quite dated. Showers needing cleaning badly. \n\nStaff service was ok but for some reason it felt that they weren't trained to Taj standards (we were entering the restaurant and a staff leaving the same did not bother to keep the door open or wish us. Just merrily slammed the door on my wife)\n\nThe food was the most disappointing. Their signature dish \"chicken Kathi roll\" was mainly onions with sprinkling of chicken. I had to send back the pasta at the restaurant because the pasta itself was undercooked. \n\nThe only reason I can see anyone stays here is that the are traveling with small kids and their kids like a pool full of other kids (and hence no real adults swimming here)\n\nNote - Had a lovely conversation with the GM of the property who totally took my feedback and assured of action on the food front. All the best ",

History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

I loved it so much the first time that I came back and chose the venue for my wedding last month. The place is very green and quiet. The peace and the view are worth a million bucks. There are at least 5 kinds of rooms so please talk to Viola (she handles the reception) which room would suit you best. The resort is on a small cliff overlooking ashvem beach and the beach is just a few steps down. Not too crowded, good places to hand out around the resort as well. The biggest thing for me was the hospitality. The staff was super courteous and friendly and I began to feel like I'd been living there for quite a while. \n\nThe best part for me was that the place is pet friendly and takes care of a lot of dogs at the beach. My two pups loved their stay. \n\nMy wedding was a small 120 people affair and every guest has been thrilled with the venue and the food. The hospitality was top notch. It felt like I got married at a friend's place and not at a hotel. Loved it. Do try their Lavash and BBQs!",

All the festivities with the beach as the backdrop was perfect!\n\nThe resort is perched on a cliff and this gives the resort a natural and gorgeous elevation. The beach facing part of the resort is like a wallpaper!! You need to just take 10 steps down to have sand under your feet. There are also a number of great shacks on the beach side in case you want to grab a bite somewhere.\n\nTo make sure you have a good view, request that your room is one of the older block ones. The older block is closer to the beach and the newer block is closer to the resort's gate)\n\nMy room was in the new blocks. While it did not have a view, the good thing was that it was spacious and new and had good amount of natural light and (electrical) lighting. The only problem was wifi - probably because the room was the end of the new block. Since we were here for a wedding, a working intercom between rooms would have been great; the phone does connect to the reception though and maybe they can route you to another room if need be.\n\nThe breakfast works on a coupon system. You can collect the coupons for the duration your stay and give one each day when you go to the breakfast hall. The range of breakfast is decent.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. If you need something, the staff and reception desk will be happy to help. The desk will help you book a cab to the airport (takes about 1.5 - 2 hours, 1700 INR for an AC cab).\n\nThe resort has a lot of dogs so if you're a dog lover, you're in for a treat!",

Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash.

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

Lot of variety on the breakfast menu. The pool was big and clean. The beach was just a short walk away ..the bar and restaurant by the beach were good enough in the absence of shacks .

The beach is amazing,very clean and quiet. The service is excellent.The hotel caters for weddings frequently but this does not detract from the overall experience. The food is OK,not the hotels best feature.\nTwo tips,the restaurant just outside is well priced and tasty,the shop next door is a rip off,exploiting 5 star guests.",

Great pool and fabulous beach only a few minutes walk away.  Rooms comfortable with a large walk in shower in the bathroom however if could have been a bit cleaner especially the tiles in the bathroom.  Main restaurant quite good although the breakfast selection of cereals was poor.  Only 3 to choose from and no dried fruits, nuts or seeds.  This is possibly because the guests are mainly Indian.  However the quality of the food was very good.  In the evening we availed of the A la Carte on 2 nights, much better valuer than the 1300 Rupee buffet, and Fins fish restaurant on one night, expensive but the fresh fish was excellent and worth the price.  We ate outside the hotel on the other night which was very cheap.  During the day we ate in the shack restaurant on the beach, Alysha,  excellent cold beers and tandoori chicken, great value and recommended.  I believe if you stay 5 nights or more the hotel offer discounted buffet tickets, 900 instead of 1300 which would be good value.  This hotel would be much better if there was an \"All Inclusive\" option available.",

                  "travellerComment": "Hi,\nMyself and my new husband stayed for 10 nights at the zuri white sands and was amazed at how beautiful the hotel is.\nHowever there were some negatives as well as positives.\nOn arrival after a 9 hour flight and a 45 taxi journey to the hotel no refreshments were offered to neither of us, and it was witnessed by ourselves and other people that other people on arrival were offered refreshments.\nOur first night we settled in bed around 3.30am after arriving at 2am at goa airport and was awoken a couple of hours by loud banging noises and sawing. We had not been informed by the hotel staff that construction work was being done above us! \nWe had no time to adjust to the time difference.\nWhen trying to socialise at the pool was hard to hear other people as the noise was so loud and this noise continued right throughout the day.\nAfter the first day myself and my new husband decided to sit out on the balcony and relax which did not happen as my husbands chair collapsed under him which resulted in my husband falling to the side and banging his head on the floor and sustaining open wounds to his ankles and foot! \nWhen asked staff for an incident for m was told that it was not necessary for one to be completed. Staff members came to the room to remove the chair and informed ourselves that the leg of the chair was extremely rusty and caused this. Rust and debris was all over the floor on the balcony.\nFor 3 days we were awoken to the sounds of construction sounds until my husband complained that we were severely exhausted with it despite going to bed early on our honeymoon and he asked for a room change which we got.\nSome of the staff members were extremely rude but a duty manager Elaine was extremely helpful and understanding with us both.\nMy husband and I were offered a free nights dinner in the Buffett bar due to the injuries sustained. Food rating in our eyes were poor and would advise people to eat outside of the hotel. On the beach there is a shack which is not owned by the hotel and the food there is excellent.\nOn changing rooms my husband was assured that everything was safety checked.\nI am sure this was not completely true and my husband could have suffered an electric shock as when he went to plug a charger in plug socket exposed live wires.\nAgain maintenance came to the room and had to completely change the whole socket.\nThe hotel offered us 30% of the bar bill which we feel was an insult to us both through to the stress and worrying endured by us both.\nThe hotel itself is lovely and well kept and the staff are lovely caring people apart from select few duty managers.\nThere is a Chinese restaurant and food is fantastic.\nThe views are beautiful is you are offered a room with a view!\nI would advise not to eat at the BBQ, after eating at the BBQ I became sick with diarrhoea and vomiting for 10 days thankfully this was at the end of my stay.\nThe hotel does not inform you of the tax they charge on both alcohol and soft drinks and this also increases a persons bill.\nThe pool is beautiful and I believe that if these things had not happened or we did not have to listen to the construction work then our stay would have been wonderful.\nI would recommend this holiday to anyone.\n",

We were upgraded from the pool view room to the villa room since we requested to get a room away from the wedding crowd.The villa room was very spacious with its own cozy balcony providing a beautiful view of the lawns & the sea. True to the many reviews, the food spread & its quality was excellent... special mention goes to the Breakfast Buffet! This property has direct access to the beach which is a superb place to unwind. They are usually always booked for corporate/wedding events but they clearly know how to handle such big groups as well as the other guests without compromising on the service of either parties...truly remarkable. The entire property of Holiday Inn is so huge and well maintained that its a great place to spend a relaxing holiday!! ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

                  "travellerComment": "This is the second year we are staying at this hotel. When we visit goa we stay almost 9-10 days. As the name suggest it is more of a guest house then a hotel. Don't expect for food or drinks as they don't serve, however u can order from close by restaurants. Breakfast is available, but only egg items and bread with tea or coffee. Rooms are not spacious but comfortable. Bathroom is clean with 24/7 hot water. There are 2 boys in the name of staff. However, they are helpful, goodmannerd and softspoken. Room has LCD TV and split ac. Not all channels are available especially sports. But who watches TV when u r on vacation. WiFi is available and speed is fine. You need to be in the courtyard to access WiFi as the WiFi network goes off when u r in the room. The Courtyard is clean and has two tables with 3 chairs to spend ur time. There is a small recreation area at the back with 2 bean bags. U also can wash ur clothes and hangers are provided in the recreation area to dry clothes. They don't accept credit cards though so be prepared to pay in cash or EFT. The best thing is that the owner \"Mogambo\" also deals in car and bike rentals. U can hire a cab though him for pickup and drop from airport or railway station. Also, u can take bike, Scooter or car on rent. The rate varies depending upon the model and number of days. U have choice of activa, dio, avenger, fz, royal Enfield, navi..etc and cars like i10 or Chevy spark. Petrol is cheaper compared to other states and also available in every nook and corner in 1 ltr bisleri bottle. This hotel is nearby to some famous places like mango tree, thalassa, bean me up, chaporo fort, anjuna beach and small vagator beach. Anjuna petrol pump is close by. Also, next to petrol pump is Sita udupi hotel where u can have breakfast at reasonable rates. Having stayed here twice I like the place and have no complaints except for one that they don't accept credit cards. Hope they do that in future.",

The service provided by the staff is excellent.Tea/coffee is available.  I would recommend not to opt for a breakfast included package - there is no variety available , rather you order from the nearby restaurant or go out to eat. If you get a deal withing 900-1200/- INR per night its a good deal.Beds are comfy and service is prompt , since our AC wasnt cooling they got the repair guy to visit and fix it.  Wifi doesnt reach all the rooms.",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

                  "travellerComment": "My wife and I booked in for three nights prior to our return to the UK as this hotel is close to the airport and had good reviews.\nOur first impressions were very favourable. The pool is free-style and very attractive, especially when lit up at night and the grounds too are beautiful. The rooms are in individual chalet style buildings with one room on the ground floor and one on the upstairs level and are beautifully appointed. The bed was very comfortable and the wet room nicely laid out with a shower which provided plenty of water and was easily controlled temperature wise with no fluctuations either in volume or temperature.\nThe admin block is well set up with reception, bar and restaurant all of which are tastefully decorated. There is also a games area, in a separate block, which has a library of second hand books as well as table-tennis. We did not, however avail ourselves of this so I am a little hazy about the details. Downstairs in this block there are also toilets and showers which are handy when using the swimming pool.\nOn check-in we were greeted with a welcome drink of coconut juice in a coconut and we were allowed to eat the flesh afterwards.\nAll the staff we came into contact with were helpful and friendly without being over familiar and always seemed to be on hand when needed but without giving the impression of hovering.\nThe one problem, however, was the food. Given the quality of the hotel, we were expecting something special but were bitterly disappointed. Our first meal was a snack lunch taken beside the swimming pool. My wife had chicken satay which was acceptable and I had nachos which were not very good. For dinner, the first night, my wife had prawn cocktail followed by chicken in tarragon sauce and I had crab-cakes followed by surf and turf. My wife's starter was over-spiced and there was a distinct shortage of prawns whereas my crab cakes were ok but the accompanying dip had to be used very sparingly or the chilly flavour would totally overpower the crab. Our main courses both contained meat which was so tough as to be virtually inedible and my steak was overcooked. When we complained the chef came out and admitted that he thought the chicken had looked dry and tough when he took it from the oven. We didn't dare have a dessert and as far as possible ate elsewhere.\nThe breakfasts were ok but the bacon was tough and chewy.\nOn our last evening we again ate at the hotel. Our starters were ok and so was my wife's main course of linguini. I tried the pork chops which, again, were so tough as to be indigestible.\nIt would appear that the proprietor needs to change both his chef and his butcher urgently!\nThe final criticism is the price. At the equivalent of £120 per night this hotel is charging at the level of good quality hotels in London (we only paid £100 per night at the Hilton near Heathrow) but without the associated costs in terms of staff, power or taxes.",

I wish we had stayed for longer as it is so quiet in the grounds and just a 3 min walk from the beach 10 min to a nice small town\nThe Staff could not do enough for us  I will be coming back",

Pool was great and very safe for our toddler. He enjoyed the pool toys. The beach is very close and clean by Indian standards. Quiet and largely used by locals. We loved it! Patrolled by lifeguards ensured safety. Security guards also on hand. Breakfast was good. Food at restaurant fair otherwise ok...we enjoyed the mocktails by the poolside! Only downside was the driver provided by the hotel the night we ventured to the Saturday night markets. He was reckless and ended up leaving us stranded for a long period. Upon his return he argued with us which was unacceptable. This was a disappointing blemish on an otherwise wonderful holiday. Would recommend to family's :)",

One of the biggest pros is its proximity to the Dabolim airport (not more than a 10-min drive) and added bonus is complimentary transfers to the airport which made things very comfortable and the overall experience hassle free (considering that we had kids). Hospitality offered is absolutely commendable! Rooms are not many in number and that makes it a cozy little place, a 5-min walk from the Bogmalo Beach. It is a quiet beach with pristine sands, a visual treat during sunset and sunrise. Food in the resort is above average but the nearest joint - Joet's, which is located on the beach, is more popular as it has better food and ambiance (of course as it's ocean front!). Last but not the least, one should not miss visiting Claudie's (located a few km away from the resort). This place has amazing food and beverages with a vibrant ambiance. We could sit here like all day and still not get bored! Must visit for the resort guests.\nIt was a very pleasant experience at Coconut Creek and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

                  "travellerComment": "This is the second year we are staying at this hotel. When we visit goa we stay almost 9-10 days. As the name suggest it is more of a guest house then a hotel. Don't expect for food or drinks as they don't serve, however u can order from close by restaurants. Breakfast is available, but only egg items and bread with tea or coffee. Rooms are not spacious but comfortable. Bathroom is clean with 24/7 hot water. There are 2 boys in the name of staff. However, they are helpful, goodmannerd and softspoken. Room has LCD TV and split ac. Not all channels are available especially sports. But who watches TV when u r on vacation. WiFi is available and speed is fine. You need to be in the courtyard to access WiFi as the WiFi network goes off when u r in the room. The Courtyard is clean and has two tables with 3 chairs to spend ur time. There is a small recreation area at the back with 2 bean bags. U also can wash ur clothes and hangers are provided in the recreation area to dry clothes. They don't accept credit cards though so be prepared to pay in cash or EFT. The best thing is that the owner \"Mogambo\" also deals in car and bike rentals. U can hire a cab though him for pickup and drop from airport or railway station. Also, u can take bike, Scooter or car on rent. The rate varies depending upon the model and number of days. U have choice of activa, dio, avenger, fz, royal Enfield, navi..etc and cars like i10 or Chevy spark. Petrol is cheaper compared to other states and also available in every nook and corner in 1 ltr bisleri bottle. This hotel is nearby to some famous places like mango tree, thalassa, bean me up, chaporo fort, anjuna beach and small vagator beach. Anjuna petrol pump is close by. Also, next to petrol pump is Sita udupi hotel where u can have breakfast at reasonable rates. Having stayed here twice I like the place and have no complaints except for one that they don't accept credit cards. Hope they do that in future.",

The service provided by the staff is excellent.Tea/coffee is available.  I would recommend not to opt for a breakfast included package - there is no variety available , rather you order from the nearby restaurant or go out to eat. If you get a deal withing 900-1200/- INR per night its a good deal.Beds are comfy and service is prompt , since our AC wasnt cooling they got the repair guy to visit and fix it.  Wifi doesnt reach all the rooms.",

(also all the hotel have been beautiful wooden decorative).  \nJalsa restaurant was perfect with the best vegetarian food that you have ever seen with kind manager and very delicious food.\nI want to specially thanks from Durgesh, I think he is a supervisor in reception, But he did everything for us, he is a very modest man, he is really great man that he managed a photographer for us that we could take a pictures with our weeding dresses in each parts of hotel that he wanted. Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash.

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

                  "travellerComment": "This is the second year we are staying at this hotel. When we visit goa we stay almost 9-10 days. As the name suggest it is more of a guest house then a hotel. Don't expect for food or drinks as they don't serve, however u can order from close by restaurants. Breakfast is available, but only egg items and bread with tea or coffee. Rooms are not spacious but comfortable. Bathroom is clean with 24/7 hot water. There are 2 boys in the name of staff. However, they are helpful, goodmannerd and softspoken. Room has LCD TV and split ac. Not all channels are available especially sports. But who watches TV when u r on vacation. WiFi is available and speed is fine. You need to be in the courtyard to access WiFi as the WiFi network goes off when u r in the room. The Courtyard is clean and has two tables with 3 chairs to spend ur time. There is a small recreation area at the back with 2 bean bags. U also can wash ur clothes and hangers are provided in the recreation area to dry clothes. They don't accept credit cards though so be prepared to pay in cash or EFT. The best thing is that the owner \"Mogambo\" also deals in car and bike rentals. U can hire a cab though him for pickup and drop from airport or railway station. Also, u can take bike, Scooter or car on rent. The rate varies depending upon the model and number of days. U have choice of activa, dio, avenger, fz, royal Enfield, navi..etc and cars like i10 or Chevy spark. Petrol is cheaper compared to other states and also available in every nook and corner in 1 ltr bisleri bottle. This hotel is nearby to some famous places like mango tree, thalassa, bean me up, chaporo fort, anjuna beach and small vagator beach. Anjuna petrol pump is close by. Also, next to petrol pump is Sita udupi hotel where u can have breakfast at reasonable rates. Having stayed here twice I like the place and have no complaints except for one that they don't accept credit cards. Hope they do that in future.",

The service provided by the staff is excellent.Tea/coffee is available.  I would recommend not to opt for a breakfast included package - there is no variety available , rather you order from the nearby restaurant or go out to eat. If you get a deal withing 900-1200/- INR per night its a good deal.Beds are comfy and service is prompt , since our AC wasnt cooling they got the repair guy to visit and fix it.  Wifi doesnt reach all the rooms.",

Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash.

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

We had a great time in the pool. Service was impeccable too. Their breakfast buffet spread is very good too.\n\nCouple of concern areas :\n1. At the time of check in one of their staff tried to push us to pay 2000k extra to upgrade the room,when I said we are ok with the room we have booked, she started bargaining and said pay 1000 instead of 2k for upgrade. I politely declined again but she kept on pushing till I firmly refused. Finally she says sir as a welcome gesture we have upgraded your room without any extra charge. This whole episode was little annoying but thankfully there were no such issues later.\n\n2. They have loud music playing till very late which wasn't a problem for us but some people may find it annoying.\n3.Room service quality is very average for the exhorbitant price you pay.\n\n4. It's? little off the main road although not too far.\n\nOverall  a great property. We would like to visit again\n\nOverall fantastic lropw",

History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

                  "travellerComment": "This is the second year we are staying at this hotel. When we visit goa we stay almost 9-10 days. As the name suggest it is more of a guest house then a hotel. Don't expect for food or drinks as they don't serve, however u can order from close by restaurants. Breakfast is available, but only egg items and bread with tea or coffee. Rooms are not spacious but comfortable. Bathroom is clean with 24/7 hot water. There are 2 boys in the name of staff. However, they are helpful, goodmannerd and softspoken. Room has LCD TV and split ac. Not all channels are available especially sports. But who watches TV when u r on vacation. WiFi is available and speed is fine. You need to be in the courtyard to access WiFi as the WiFi network goes off when u r in the room. The Courtyard is clean and has two tables with 3 chairs to spend ur time. There is a small recreation area at the back with 2 bean bags. U also can wash ur clothes and hangers are provided in the recreation area to dry clothes. They don't accept credit cards though so be prepared to pay in cash or EFT. The best thing is that the owner \"Mogambo\" also deals in car and bike rentals. U can hire a cab though him for pickup and drop from airport or railway station. Also, u can take bike, Scooter or car on rent. The rate varies depending upon the model and number of days. U have choice of activa, dio, avenger, fz, royal Enfield, navi..etc and cars like i10 or Chevy spark. Petrol is cheaper compared to other states and also available in every nook and corner in 1 ltr bisleri bottle. This hotel is nearby to some famous places like mango tree, thalassa, bean me up, chaporo fort, anjuna beach and small vagator beach. Anjuna petrol pump is close by. Also, next to petrol pump is Sita udupi hotel where u can have breakfast at reasonable rates. Having stayed here twice I like the place and have no complaints except for one that they don't accept credit cards. Hope they do that in future.",

The service provided by the staff is excellent.Tea/coffee is available.  I would recommend not to opt for a breakfast included package - there is no variety available , rather you order from the nearby restaurant or go out to eat. If you get a deal withing 900-1200/- INR per night its a good deal.Beds are comfy and service is prompt , since our AC wasnt cooling they got the repair guy to visit and fix it.

Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash.

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

Resort is located  6 kms from Panjim and 8 kms from Calangute beach which is very good because you can cover both these places in 15 mins ride. If you are looking for a property nearby beach, then this resort is not for you. 2 pure vegetarian restaurants are situated in 100-200 meters of resort which gives a big relief to vegans. A bike rent service provider is available just from 300-400 meters walking distance from the resort. \n\nReceptionists are calm and ready to help you every-time. When we entered into room; room was very clean as well as bathroom. Though bathroom is not much large and not having bathtub but staff maintain cleanliness inside the bathroom in proper manner. \n\nYou will find a Bed, Dressing Table, Center Table, Small almirah, LED, AC, Electronic ketlee, cups, bottles and a Safe which make you assure about your precious things. Room services is provided on daily basis without any cost. They change bed-sheets, towels, bottles, cups and doormate. Housekeeping service is Average. Sometimes, you need to make 2-3 calls to place an order. \n\nOther amenities are Swimming Pool, Gym, Table Tennis, Carrom, Pool side area for drinks and breakfast, conference hall, bar, restaurant and parking. \n\nSwimming pool is very clean, Gym equipments are in working state and beautiful greenery all around the resort. There are lots of awesome places inside the resort which gives perfect background for photoshoot.\n\nYou will be served a delicious breakfast daily in morning 7:30-11 AM. Huge varities of food along with Tea, Coffee and Juice. You can easily skip your lunch as enough quantity and varitiy is offered. \n\nFruit market, General Stores, Milk Shops, Shopping mall, Bus stop, Petrol pump; all are available in the proximity of 2 kms from the resort. so your basic need wont ever be stopped.\n\nI would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place for a family stay, Class resort, Peaceful environment, Helping Staff, Beautiful interior and above all, its VERY ECONOMICAL. Go for it without any hesitation. I am sure, you will definitely give a 4 star rating.",

The rooms were big with good lighting and excellent bathroom. However the toiletries could have been better. Excellent swimming pool as well. Worth for 3k. A family of 3 can comfortably fit in the room.\n\n1 BIG CON:\nTHE RECEPTION LADIES WERE WAY WAY WAY STRICT AND DID NOT TREAT US LIKE GUESTS. REALLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE. RESORT ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CHANGE THEM SOON.",

The busstop is just around 500 meters from the resort. Though the location is amidst Porvorim town area, once we are inside the resort, it is like very peaceful and calm atmosphere. Beaches (Calangute/Baga) are around 8 Kms from the resort. Rooms were clean and fairly spacious.\n\nFood and booze were nominal rate, I guess (Shacks at Baga had the same price as in here) and were tasty.\n\nResort has a swimming pool, indoor games room and gym facilities too.\n\nStaffs were generally friendly except for the lady in the reception, who was like kindergarten teacher-very assertive and aggressive in her tone. I should also mention about Niel-the restaurant staff, he was very friendly and benign to us.\n\nMake sure you change the towel-it looks and feels very old and the threads fall off while we wipe off after a bath.",

The rooms are spacious, but amenities are basic (eg when they say free toiletries, it just a very tiny piece of soap and sachet of shampoo; bed is thin mattress etc). It is a very clean, well maintained and comfortable hotel if you looking for a good price, central location and friendly service, but not luxurious. If you want something luxurious and very close to the beach, then this is not for you.\n\nMore than the rooms, I liked the design of the resort. It was number of double storey buildings with two to three rooms in each. The deluxe room, which we were upgraded to had a separate living area. We also liked the additional facilities of the swimming pool, gym and games room that had table tennis and a carom board. It has some eating places close-by but not extensive.",

(also all the hotel have been beautiful wooden decorative).  \nJalsa restaurant was perfect with the best vegetarian food that you have ever seen with kind manager and very delicious food.\nI want to specially thanks from Durgesh, I think he is a supervisor in reception, But he did everything for us, he is a very modest man, he is really great man that he managed a photographer for us that we could take a pictures with our weeding dresses in each parts of hotel that he wanted. Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash.

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

(A True 4 star Hotel Buffet)\nFood at its Grapevine restaurant is really good. \nComplimentary Wine(not a good one, though).\nGood Toiletries. \nNegative: Poor room service, had to call multiple times to get what i needed. \nSwimming pool was in bad condition, as if not maintained for more than a week.\nFew of the Room's light weren't working and Room's mini Fridge wasn't cooling. \n\nStaff: 4/5 (Giving extra 1 for giving us early checking, Thankful to them)\nService: 2.5/5\nProperty: 3.5/5\nValue for Money: 4/5",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak. Let's begin the voyage to the craziest Land of India...<br /><br /></p>",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

It is not just the hotel facilities that made our stay so great, but definitely and most certain it was the staff that made our stay unforgettable. From the manager of the hotel to the cleaning staff, they all do their very best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Some highlights: the beds/matrasses are very comfortable, the rooms are kept very clean and the food is delicious (our compliments to the chef!). We can keep going on about how wonderfull the hotel and the staff is, but just experience it for yourself! We will certainly come back!",

There are two ways to reach the beach, one is opposite to the hotel there is a small lane that takes you directly to the beach OR follow the main road it will pass through the market but it is bit far (in case you wanna buy shorts, t-shirts etc. you can take second route).\n\nStaff: Wonderful staff. We reached hotel early than the check-in time. Rooms were full so we could not check-in early, however staff allowed us to use the washroom and served us welcome drinks etc. Also, we spent sometime in the restaurant. Housekeeping boys were good and helpful, specially I wld like to thank Babu. \n\nFood & Room Service : Awesome food and service. We had goan sea food and punjabi veg food. Taste was very good and it was not expensive too. When we ordered food, it was served in the room within 15 - 20 mins. We had asked hot milk for our kid and requested to provided it asap, it was given to us in within 7-8 mins.\n\nBreakfast : Breakfast has options like 1 juice, tea, coffee, bread-omelet, bread butter-jam, boiled egg, toast these are for all days and paratha, idli-wada etc. keeps changing.",

The Hotel is 10 minutes walking distance from the Calengute beach. The Staff is wonderful, especially the hotel manager, Renuka. She looks after the guests well and is always helpful. She made my stay extremely comfortable and went out of her way to extend a warm and welcoming stay. Right from my pickup upto my drop back she arranged it all so well. The room service guy, Bishnu is also well trained in all areas, including wifi, AC :-) and he goes that extra mile to fix all issues for the guests. The rooms on the third floor are renovated rooms.",

(also all the hotel have been beautiful wooden decorative).  \nJalsa restaurant was perfect with the best vegetarian food that you have ever seen with kind manager and very delicious food.\nI want to specially thanks from Durgesh, I think he is a supervisor in reception, But he did everything for us, he is a very modest man, he is really great man that he managed a photographer for us that we could take a pictures with our weeding dresses in each parts of hotel that he wanted. Durgesh kindly accepted each things that we wanted without any hesitate. We came back to our home, but we have two new friends : Durgesh and Parkash. We could not forget the best times that we have had in resort rio hotel. We could not forget Durgesh and Parkash.\nThank you so much Durgesh.\nThank you so much Parkash.\nI think the manager of resort rio hotel should be proud with the professional person like as Durgesh and Parkash. We have not forgotten them and I am sure we will come back again to beautiful resort rio hotel.",

                  "travellerComment": "We travelled to Goa with Thomas Cook in March this year. We booked he Premium Economy seats and found the air travel surprising OK - we were prepared for much worse being regular scheduled travellers, but the food, service alcohol and entertainment was pretty good. \n\nOn arrival in Goa late evening we were transported to the hotel in a shared minibus that had seen better days and was hot and sticky, but hey you're in India right! \n\nOn arrival at Resort Rio, just after 2 am, we were shown to our room in the main building. I had e-mailed ahead asking for a quiet room away from any bars or entertainment and the night Receptionist assured us that the room we were allocated was what we had asked for. The room was huge, very clean with a large bathroom and balcony, but the fixtures and fittings were tired and a little shabby. at just after 5am we were woken by Housekeeping trying to deliver Tea and Coffee, at 7:30 the banging started. \n\nWe admitted defeat at just after 8 am and went downstairs. On leaving the room, the source of the banging was clear to see, our room was above a Air Conditioning ducting fabrication 'workshop'!\n\nWe asked at Reception and a lovely lady agreed to see what she could do to help. There was a conference in the Hotel, (the first of many) and at around lunchtime we were treated to a gaggle of Indian men, conference attendees, who were eager to use the pool. So eager that they stripped to underpants, abandoning clothes and possessions on our sunbeds and had a fair old time drinking and being rowdy. I'm no prude, in my late 40's, no shrinking violet and far from body beautiful, but the stares and ogling did become a little uncomfortable, so we left. \n\nThankfully the Reception team came up trumps and relocated us to the Resort Rio new wing located over the road. The room was newly furnished and very comfortable. \n\nThe pool area at Resort Rio was much, much quieter and we had superb service from Joe the pool attendant throughout our stay. The food (we opted for AI), was very good and the chef team could not do enough to help, indeed the Team at the Sweet Caju were as good as any hotel could wish for, BUT.....\n\n1. There are very few tourists in the Hotel. We like a drink in a bar and the occasional interaction with other travellers, but the majority of Hotel Guests were Conference goers or Indians visiting family... evenings were a little dull.\n2. If you want to go out in the evening it is a taxi ride away. After dinner there is little to do and the Hotel Bar is far from buzzing!\n3. During our second week the Iranians arrived for their New Year celebrations and the peace was shattered. The hotel was completely full of Iranians, nice people, but intent on having their own music and at entertainment. Not ideal. One evening we were prevented from sitting outside because their was a private party.. Why not open the Bar at the Resort Rio to give other guests somewhere to go?? \n4.  The Iranians are REALLY noisy. Music, moving furniture around, slamming doors, clapping all contributed to several disturbed nights. \n5.  The conference business takes priority, so as a tourist you are shifted around to suit the Conference business and if you are a lady, in a bikini prepare to be ogled at.\n\nClean and comfortable but not a Resort and definitely not \"the time of my life\", think 2 weeks AI in the Heathrow Radisson but in the sun..",

Food is excellent in Mango pickle restaurant.\n But certain management issues are there. There was water logging in wash room which we daily complained to housekeeping and reception. But never got resolved. Once requested for matchbox thrice but never got. Had to go to market to buy one. Pool is good. One can spend endless time  there. Zara spa is good but a bit pricey. Restaurant was closed on second day onwards without informing guests in advance. \nHad to dine in their adjoining property. Overall it's good value for money resort san some management issues. \n\n",

The bedroom was good for a one night stay, however the bathroom was very tired and needs updating / curtains changing etc.  There isn't a lot around here to do so we are in the restaurant.  Again great service and very good food.  ATMs close by, however watch out for the unfriendly wild dog outside!  A hotel drop off was arranged by the hotel to the airport at a very good price. ",

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.

The hotel had a tropical/Caribbean feel to it.   \n\nThe hotel is low rise and quite spread out.  There is a central area where all of the restaurants except Palms are located.  The good thing is that you can share a table on the terrace and both eat from different restaurants.   Service was very good, polite and fast.  \n\nBreakfast was very good with a huge choice.  The hotel were very generous with complementary water in the room which was very much appreciated.  \n\nThe swimming pool was the perfect temperature and always had plenty of sun beds available.  We had dinner at Palms twice which was excellent and it's a lovely place for a drink and to watch the sun go down.  \n\nIf you want to try a local shack (where the food is much, much cheaper and very good) head down to the beach and to the left there is a shack called Mario (renamed from Zogo I believe).  We ate there 1 evening which was a magical experience and the crab was exceptional.  \n\nThoroughly recommend this hotel and its chilled atmosphere with good customer service.  The staff were consistently polite and couldn't do enough to help.  They appeared to learn our names which was a nice touch.   The wifi throughout the hotel was very good and fast.",

Palms restaurant has a fabulous view out over the beach and the restaurant itself is set out very nicely. We were welcomed with prosecco and told that the buffet was open and to go and have a look when we were ready. The array of food is mouthwatering, from salads to pasta, pizzas and seafood,fish and beef tenderloin. The drinks are replenished regularly and there is a wide range of international wines, spirits and cocktails on offer. Very chilled out vibe with live music which is not intrusive. A fab venue which we will definitely revisit, and would highly recommend. ",

The food used to get over even before all the guests could eat.\nStaff service also not upto the mark.",

Room was well maintained and properly cleaned. Food was very delicious. Everyday there is poolside party at 7 Pm for one hour there they serve free drinks which is also a plus point and people can interact each others. All staff people were very courteous. They offered free meals to our baby.\nThank you to upgrade our room. This is a perfect family hotel.",

There is something in the Goan air that makes <strong>fun &amp; cheer</strong> infectious, and you can't help but throw away your worries and <strong>eat, drink, laugh and enjoy</strong> instinctively.<br /><br />Hop on to a two-wheeler, may be a <strong>guttural Enfield</strong>. It's not hard to find a ride with rental guys pitching their scooters with corny comments. It is the best way to <strong>get around town</strong> and to the open invitation of the <strong>sun, sand and seafood</strong>.<br /><br />Noisy north Goan beaches, <strong>action packed water sports</strong>, bright markets, medieval <strong>forts</strong>, pre-historic rocks, calmer <strong>white sand beaches</strong> and a parallel <strong>hippie culture</strong> are some aspects of Goa that you'll come across. History has settled comfortably in Goa, evident in its architecture and the many <strong>churches and cathedrals</strong>. Old Goa takes her place in the sun once a year during the <strong>feast of St Xavier</strong>, which is a crowd puller and the trademark celebratory spirit is at its peak.
